* Packaging

  * The `OPTS` and `ARGS` variables used when defining packages have become built-ins now, so they should be modified **in-place** (using `OPTS.update()`, `OPTS['xxx']`, and `ARGS.extend()`, `ARGS.append()` or any other functions that mutates the object).

    You should **NEVER** re-bind (re-assign) these variables (`OPTS = ...`, `ARGS = ...` or even `ARGS += ...` and any other operators that re-assign the variable are forbidden).

    Also, if you are using a `defaults.py` file, now just use `Ã¬mport defaults` in `.pkg` files using it, don't explicitly import the `OPTS` and `ARGS` symbols anymore:

    Change `from defaults import OPTS, ARGS` to `import defaults`.

    This change helps making much more compact utility functions. See changes on `FUN.desc()` for an example.

  * The `FUN.desc()` function for defining packages now doesn't take `OPTS` as an argument, it just gets the `OPTS['description']` from the built-in `OPTS`.

    Change `FUN.desc(OPTS, ...)` to `FUN.desc(...)`.

  * The deprecated packaging function `FUN.mapbins()` was removed, use `FUN.mapfiles()` instead.

  * The deprecated packaging variable `VAR.name` was removed, use `VAR.fullname` instead.
