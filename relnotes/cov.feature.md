# Coverage support

Now MakD will handle compiling and running with code coverage if `COV=1` is
used. This should be provided for both compiling and running tests. Please
refer to the documentation for more details.

Full support in only provided by the following DMD runtime versions (merging
coverage reports support is needed for this to work properly):

* ``dmd1``: tangort v1.8.0+
* ``dmd-transitional``: v2.070.2.s15+ and v2.071.2.s4+
* ``dmd``: v2.078.0+
