Migration Instructions
======================

* The `Version` alias to `versionInfo` provided by the `Version` module has been removed.
  All remaining usage can be replaced with `versionInfo`.

* The `D_GC` variable was removed as it wasn't used internally anymore.
  If you made use of it anywhere, you should define it yourself (in `Config.mak` for example) from now on.

* The deprecated packaging function `FUN.mapbins()` was removed, use
  `FUN.mapfiles()` instead.

* The deprecated packaging variable `VAR.name` was removed, use `VAR.fullname`
  instead.

* The ``OPTS`` and ``ARGS`` variables used when defining packages have become
  built-ins now, so they should be modified **in-place** (using
  ``OPTS.update()``, ``OPTS['xxx']``, and ``ARGS.extend()``, ``ARGS.append()``
  or any other functions that mutates the object).

  You should **NEVER** re-bind (re-assign) these variables (``OPTS = ...``,
  ``ARGS = ...`` or even ``ARGS += ...`` and any other operators that re-assign
  the variable are forbidden).

  Also, if you are using a ``defaults.py`` file, now just use ``Ã¬mport
  defaults`` in ``.pkg`` files using it, don't explicitly import the ``OPTS``
  and ``ARGS`` symbols anymore:

  Change ``from defaults import OPTS, ARGS`` to ``import defaults``.

  This change helps making much compact utility functions.
