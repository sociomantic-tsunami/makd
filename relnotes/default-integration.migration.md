* Integration tests default location changed from `test` to `integrationtest`.

  The location can be set explicitly via the variable `INTEGRATIONTEST`, but you are not required to define it anymore (as it was required in v1.x.x), you just need to define it if you don't want the new default (`integrationtest`).
